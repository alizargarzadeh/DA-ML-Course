# Diabetes Dataset Exploration: Linear Regression and Feature Impact
This Python script explores a linear regression model's performance on the Diabetes dataset using scikit-learn. It begins by loading the dataset, displaying its features and target variable, and subsequently visualizing the individual features through scatter plots. The script then applies a linear regression model to the entire dataset and each individual feature, presenting the corresponding R-squared scores as a measure of model performance.
