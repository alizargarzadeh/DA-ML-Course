# Understanding the Cost Function in Linear Regression for BTC Price Analysis
This Python script employs pandas, numpy, and both Matplotlib and Plotly for data manipulation and visualization to explore the cost function in the context of linear regression. It reads Bitcoin (BTC) price data from a CSV file, calculates the cost function for various weights (w) and biases (b), and presents the results through a combination of 2D and 3D plots. The script provides an insightful visual representation of the relationship between model parameters and the cost function in the context of linear regression.
