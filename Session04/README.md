# From CSV to MySQL: Managing Bitcoin Price Information

This Python script utilizes the pandas and mysql.connector libraries to process and store Bitcoin (BTC) price data from a CSV file into a MySQL database. The script calculates the benefit and tolerance based on open, close, high, and low prices, and then establishes a connection to a MySQL database to create a table and populate it with the processed data.

# Dynamic BTC Price Inquiry using Python and CoinAPI
This Python script utilizes the CoinAPI to fetch real-time exchange rate data for Bitcoin (BTC) against the US Dollar (USD) for a specified date. The user is prompted to input a date, and the script then constructs a request to the CoinAPI endpoint, retrieves the exchange rate information, and outputs the result in JSON format.
