# From CSV to MySQL: Managing Bitcoin Price Information

This Python script utilizes the pandas and mysql.connector libraries to process and store Bitcoin (BTC) price data from a CSV file into a MySQL database. The script calculates the benefit and tolerance based on open, close, high, and low prices, and then establishes a connection to a MySQL database to create a table and populate it with the processed data.
