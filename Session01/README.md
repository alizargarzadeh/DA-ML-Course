# Visualizing Major Cities with Basemap in USA: Population Distribution (2023)
This Python code creates a map of cities in the USA and visualizes their population data using the Basemap library from Matplotlib. The code reads city information from a CSV file, sets up the map projection, and plots the cities on the map, with marker size proportional to their population. The resulting map displays city locations, state boundaries, coastlines, and country borders.

# Visualizing Major Cities with Basemap in Iran: Population Distribution (2023)
The code begins by creating a figure and defining a Basemap object that sets the map's boundaries and projection. It then defines information about several major Iranian cities, including their names, geographical coordinates, and population sizes. The code proceeds to draw map features such as coastlines, countries, map boundaries, continents, parallels, and meridians. It then plots the city locations on the map, adjusting the size of the points based on the population of each city. Finally, it adds a legend and sets a title for the plot before displaying the map.

# Plotting the Pandemic: Tracking Coronavirus Cases in Iranian Cities
This Python script utilizes the pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries to analyze and visualize COVID-19 statistics for ten different cities in Iran. The script loads data from a CSV file containing coronavirus statistics for various provinces. It then extracts specific columns related to selected cities, creates a new DataFrame, and finally generates a line plot to illustrate the total number of coronavirus cases in each city over a period of time.
