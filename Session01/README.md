# USA City Population Map with Basemap: 2023 Data Visualization
This Python code creates a map of cities in the USA and visualizes their population data using the Basemap library from Matplotlib. The code reads city information from a CSV file, sets up the map projection, and plots the cities on the map, with marker size proportional to their population. The resulting map displays city locations, state boundaries, coastlines, and country borders.
