This code utilizes a Bitcoin dataset spanning from August 4, 2022, to August 4, 2023. In the initial section, the dates are converted to the Jalali calendar, and subsequently, the most profitable week is determined. The outcome reveals that the fifty-second week of the year 1402 is the most lucrative. Moving to the second part, the optimal day for investors is identified, with Tuesday emerging as the most favorable for investment. The third part aims to compute the most resilient day. To achieve this, the high price is subtracted from the low price, and the results are then summed. The analysis indicates that Wednesday is the most resilient day.

In the fourth part, the scenario is considered where an investor purchases $1000 worth of Bitcoin on August 13, 2022, at the opening price. Every Wednesday, the investor sells at the closing price and reinvests the remaining deposit on Saturdays. The question posed is: How much money does the investor have at the end of November 16, 2022? To address this query, the relevant days of the week pertaining to the trader are isolated. Subsequently, the profit, computed as the difference between the closing and opening prices, is calculated and summed for these five days. Following this, a new dataset is generated, comprising fourteen intervals with opening and accrued benefits. The result is then divided by the opening price for each week. This process is repeated for all fourteen intervals, revealing that the amount of money after this investment has decreased to $666.51.
