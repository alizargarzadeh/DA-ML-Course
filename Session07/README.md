# Cross_Validation_Diabetes
This Python script utilizes the scikit-learn library to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model on the Diabetes dataset using various cross-validation techniques. The code compares the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) across different cross-validation methods, including train-test split, leave-one-out, and K-fold. The script provides insights into the model's robustness and generalization across different validation strategies, offering a comprehensive evaluation of its predictive capabilities.

## Result
The analysis demonstrates that the model's performance varies depending on the choice of cross-validation method. Each technique has its strengths and limitations, influencing the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. The results highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate cross-validation strategy based on the characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the modeling task. The script serves as a valuable tool for assessing model reliability and guiding the selection of an effective cross-validation approach for future modeling endeavors.
