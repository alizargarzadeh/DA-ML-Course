# Optimizing Logistic Regression: Unveiling Relationships Between Features, Samples, and Performance
This Python script systematically explores the impact of varying dataset characteristics on the performance of a Logistic Regression model. By manipulating the number of samples, features, and standard deviation in synthetic datasets, the script measures the training time, accuracy, and their relationships. The results are then visualized in a series of plots, offering insights into the trade-offs and dependencies between dataset size, feature complexity, model accuracy, and training time.

## Conclusion:
The analysis reveals valuable trends and considerations for Logistic Regression model performance across diverse dataset configurations. As the number of features increases, the time required for model training rises, demonstrating the computational cost of higher-dimensional data. Additionally, the relationship between the number of samples and model accuracy is depicted, illustrating the impact of dataset size on predictive performance. These insights are crucial for understanding the interplay between dataset characteristics and model behavior, providing practical guidance for selecting appropriate dataset sizes and feature complexities in logistic regression tasks. The script, by generating and analyzing synthetic datasets, serves as a useful tool for exploring the dynamics of logistic regression in different scenarios.
